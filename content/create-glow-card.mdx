Create high-quality, type-safe, reusable React components with TypeScript and tailwindcss.

## Install Dependencies
Install necessary dependencies to make everything easier. The following example is from a Nextjs 13 project with TypeScript.

### clsx
A tiny utility for constructing className strings conditionally.

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx)

```bash
npm install clsx
```

### tailwind-merge
Utility function to efficiently merge Tailwind CSS classes in JS without style conflicts.

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-merge)

```bash
npm install tailwind-merge
```

### class-variance-authority
CSS-in-TS type-safe library that allows us to easily define and apply CSS class variatons.

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/class-variance-authority)

```bash
npm install class-variance-authority
```

## Create Variances
We need to use the class-variance-authority to create different variances of out component,
using tailwind. It is actually very simple. we just need to `import {cva} from 'class-variance-authority'` and declare
our variances.

```tsx title="Button.tsx"
export const buttonVariants = cva(
	// Base props that all variants will have
	"text-white text-base font-semibold text-center rounded-lg cursor-pointer py-1",
	{
		variants: {
			variant: {
					default: "bg-accent-1 border border-accent-2",
					primaryGreen: "gradient-lr border border-accent-green",
			},
			size: {
					default: "w-auto px-2",
					fullWidth: "w-full",
					small: "w-auto px-1",
					medium: "w-auto px-2",
					large: "w-auto px-4",
			},
			defaultVariants: {
					variant: "default",
					size: "default",
			},
		},
	}
);
```

As you can see, we have a `buttonVariants` object that contains all the variances of our button component.
The first line of styles are the base styles that all variances will have. Then we have the `variants` object
that contains all the different variances. In this case, we have `variant` and `size`. 
- **variant** is the different color schemes that our button can have.
- **size** is the different sizes that our button can have.
DefaultVariants is where we define the default values for our variances.
